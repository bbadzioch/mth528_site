# Syllabus

A PDF version of this syllabus is available <a href="/assets/syllabus.pdf" markdown="0">here</a>.

## Lectures

* Tue 2:20 - 3:35 PM [Clemens Hall 19](http://www.buffalo.edu/home/visiting-ub/CampusMaps/maps.html#CLEMEN){:target="_blank"}
* Thu 2:20 - 3:35 PM [Clemens Hall 19](http://www.buffalo.edu/home/visiting-ub/CampusMaps/maps.html#CLEMEN){:target="_blank"}

The class will be divided in two groups, and each group will attend only
one weekly meeting. This is meant to partially offset the time that you will
need to spend watching videos with lectures, and also to assure that our
in-person meetings are small and more interactive.

**Group assignments are posted [here](/assets/group_assignments.pdf).**

## Recitations

* Thu 7:05 - 7:55 PM [Math Building 250](http://www.buffalo.edu/home/visiting-ub/CampusMaps/maps.html#MATH){:target="_blank"}

Recitations are meant primarily for students taking MTH 427, but anyone interested
can participate.

## Prerequisites

This is an abstract, proof based course. I will assume that you have experience
with mathematical proofs and you know how to read and write them. All homework
and exam problems will ask you to prove various statements on your own. The main
technical prerequisites come from calculus: you should be comfortable with the
notions of a continuous function (of one and several real variables) and a limit
of a sequence of real numbers. Prior knowledge of operations on sets (union,
intersection, difference, product) is also expected, but I will review this at
the beginning of the course.

## Learning outcomes

After completing this course students should be able to:

* Understand the notions of a metric space, topological space, subspace,
  product space, quotient space, topological manifold and provide examples
  illustrating each of these notions.
* Understand the notion of a continuous function between topological spaces and
  a homeomorphism, and be able to recognize if a given
  function is continuous and if it is a homeomorphism.
* Understand basic topological properties: metrizability, compactness, connectedness,
  path connectedness, separation axioms etc. Understand various connections between
  these properties and be able to provide examples of topological spaces that satisfy
  or do not satisfy these properties.
* Prove or disprove statements concerning topological spaces and continuous functions.



## Textbook

The course will follow lecture notes posted on this website.
If you would like to use a published text as a supplement, a popular and good
textbook is e.g. [Topology by J.R. Munkres](https://www.amazon.com/Topology-2nd-Economy-James-Munkres/dp/8120320468/ref=pd_cp_14_1?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=8120320468&pd_rd_r=4VZWC9KGC5G31YR4T9ZA&pd_rd_w=5hg0t&pd_rd_wg=60htE&psc=1&refRID=4VZWC9KGC5G31YR4T9ZA){:target="_blank"}.
There are many other good options. You can check with me if you would like to
use some other book.

## Grading

| **Homework**                          | 30% |  
| **Midtem Exam 1** &nbsp; &nbsp;       | 15% |
| **Midtem Exam 2** &nbsp; &nbsp;       | 15% |
| **Class participation** &nbsp; &nbsp; | 10% |
| **Final Exam**                        | 30% |  


## Homework

Homework problems will be assigned weekly, and will be due on Friday each week.
Students registered for MTH 527 are required to submit homework solutions typeset
in LaTeX. MTH 427 students will receive one bonus point for each homework problem
solution prepared in LaTeX (solutions that show no mathematical effort do not count).
I will give a brief introduction to LaTeX during the first week of the course.

You can collaborate on homework problems, but you must write solutions entirely on your
own. Copying solutions from other students or any other sources is a violation
of the UB academic integrity policy.

Homework assignments will be collected and returned through [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com).
I will explain in class how to use it.

## Class participation

Class participation credit will be based on two components.

**Class attendance.** You can earn up to 5% of the total course credit
for being present and on time during class meetings. You can miss one
class meeting without a justified reason. Each subsequent unexcused absence
will lower your participation credit by 1% (i.e. from 5% to 4% etc.).

**Weekly digest.** As a part of each homework you will be asked to submit
a short (2-3 sentences) writeup on your study from the previous week.
For example, you can write:

* what topics you have found interesting (or boring)
* what topics you have found difficult (or easy)
* how  you feel about the course
* anything else you want to share.

You will be also asked to submit questions that you would like to see discussed
during a class meeting.  

You can receive up to 5% credit for these writeups. You can miss one
such assignment without loosing any credit, but your weekly digest credit will be
lowered by 1% for each subsequent missed assignment.   

I may award extra credit to students who are especially active in the course.
I may also offer some extra credit opportunities for giving short presentations
on some topic etc.
