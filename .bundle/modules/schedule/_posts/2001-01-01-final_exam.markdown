### Practice final

[Here](/assets/practice_final.pdf) is a practice exam. The actual final exam will follow a similar format.

### Lecture Notes

During the exam I will provide a copy of combined lecture notes for this course
that you will be able to access on your computer. The notes will have colored background to make them
more recognizable on your computer screen for proctoring purposes. Their content will not be changed in any way.


### Exceptional situations

In case of irregularities in the written exam a student may be asked to take
an additional oral exam which will either supplement or replace the score from the written exam. The oral
exam will be administered at the discretion of the course instructor. This does not waive the rules of
the UB Academic Integrity Policy - any observed instances of cheating will result in a failing grade
on the exam or other sanctions (failure of the course etc.).
