## Course materials

The course materials posted here consist of three components:

* **Complete lecture notes** are pdf files with all content of this course.
  Each chapter of these notes includes exercises which will be used in homework
  assignments. Notes posted on this website are split into chapters, but a pdf file
  with all notes and a LaTex source file are available [here](https://github.com/bbadzioch/topology_lecture_notes).


* **Blank lecture notes** are extracts from the complete lecture notes. They contain
  definitions and statements of theorems, and leave a lot of blank spaces which are intended
  to be filled with your own notes.  


* **Videos** present material of this course. In each video I annotate blank notes
  with proofs, examples etc. while explaining what I am doing.


## How to use these materials

The intended use of these resources is as follows:

1. Print the blank notes (if you can), and watch videos while annotating them along with me.
   If you don't have access to a printer, you can just take notes in your own notebook - the
   blank notes do not contain much text anyway. Watching videos without taking notes is
   an option, but you will understand and remember much better if you are actively engaged
   with the content. Think about it as an equivalent of taking notes during a lecture.

2. In the videos I may occasionally omit some example or details of a proof, so if something
   seems unclear, have a look at the complete lecture notes - you may find the answer there.  
   If your questions persist, ask them in your Weekly Digest, during a class meeting or on
   Discord.

I tried to prepare the videos in such way, that it should be relatively easy to watch them
one page of blank notes at a time. So, if you watch enough to finish a page, then you
should be able to pick up where you left off at a later time without difficulty.
Materials for each chapter list links to parts of videos where each page of blank
notes starts.

If you don't like watching videos, you can just read the complete lecture notes. They cover all
material and they are self-contained. If you choose this route, you should still keep notes as you
read. Passive reading or watching is not a good way to learn mathematics.
