### Midterm Exam Information


* The  midterm exam will be given on **Wednesday, March 30 at 3:20-5:30 PM**.
  This extends the regular class time to 2 hours. 

* The class meeting on Monday, March 28 will be a review for the exam. 

* The scope of the exam will correspond to chapters 1-11 of the lecture notes. You can
  print these chapters and use them during the exam. No other resources (books, computers etc.)
  are permitted.

* The exam will consist of 5 problems, but for full credit you will need to solve any
  4 of them. Each problem will be worth 20 points.

* Exam problems will be similar to homework exercises, only shorter since the exam time
  is limited. Reviewing the homework assignments 1-5 and additional exercises from
  the course lecture notes is a good way to prepare for the exam.
