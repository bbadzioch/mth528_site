# Homework template

Students registered for MTH 528 are required to submit homework
solutions typeset in LaTeX. MTH 428 students will receive one bonus
point for each homework problem solution prepared in LaTeX
(solutions that show no mathematical effort do not count).

Below is a link to a LaTeX template that you can use for typesetting homework assignments.
You can use it with [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/){:target="_blank"} or any other LaTeX editor.
