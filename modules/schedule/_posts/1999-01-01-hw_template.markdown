title: Notes and Homework template

# Lecture notes

A pdf file with all notes and a LaTex source file are available
[here](https://github.com/bbadzioch/topology_lecture_notes){:target="_blank"}. I may make some minor
changes to these notes during the semester, which can affect numbering of
theorems, exercises etc. The schedule for each week will include links to the
up-to-date versions of chapters covered that week.


# Homework template

Students registered for MTH 528 are required to submit homework
solutions typeset in LaTeX. MTH 428 students will receive one bonus
point for each homework problem solution prepared in LaTeX
(solutions that show no mathematical effort do not count).

Below is a link to a LaTeX template that you can use for typesetting homework assignments.
You can use it with [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/){:target="_blank"} or any other LaTeX editor.
