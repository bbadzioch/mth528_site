## Lectures

| Mon, Wed 3:30 - 4:50 PM &nbsp; &nbsp; | [Math Building 122](http://www.buffalo.edu/home/visiting-ub/CampusMaps/maps.html#MATH){:target="_blank"} |


## Instructor

Bernard Badzioch  
**E-mail:** [badzioch@buffalo.edu](mailto:badzioch@buffalo.edu?subject=MTH 427/527)  
**Office Hours:** Mon 5:00 - 6:00 PM and by appointment.


## Prerequisites

* General topology (topological spaces, continuous functions, subspaces, product spaces, quotient spaces, compactness and path connectedness).
* Some group theory (groups, subgroups, quotient groups, homomorphisms and isomorphisms).

## Learning outcomes

After completing this course students should be able to:

* Understand the notions of a category and a functor between categories.
* Understand the notions of homotopy of functions and homotopy equivalence of topological
  spaces.
* Understand the construction of the fundamental group functor and its properties.
* Be able to compute the fundamental group of a variety spaces using such properties as homotopy
  invariance, the product formula, van Kampen's Theorem.
* Understand some applications of the fundamental group (Brouwer fixed point theorem, Borsuk-Ulam theorem,
  the fundamental theorem of algebra etc.).
* Understand the notion of a CW complex and know how to compute the fundamental group of a CW complex
  using its cell structure.
* Understand and apply some basic results of homotopy theory: the cellular approximation theorem,
  the homotopy extension property of CW complexes etc.
* Understand the notion of a covering space.
* Understand and be able to apply the results on classification theorem of covering spaces using
  the fundamental group.
* Understand the notion of a deck transformation and how the group of deck transformations of a covering
  can be expressed in terms of the fundamental group.

## Textbook

The course will follow lecture notes posted on this website.
If you would like to use a published text as a supplement, there are many books
to choose from. [Algebraic Topology by Edwin Spanier](https://amzn.to/34x2tNp){:target="_blank"} is a classic.
[Algebraic Topology by Allen Hatcher](https://amzn.to/3q6lKh8){:target="_blank"}
is another good option and it can be downloaded for free from
[Allen Hatcher's website](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html){:target="_blank"}.
The content of the course will roughly correspond to chapters 1-2 of Spanier's
book and chapters 0-1 of Hatcher's text.


## Grading

| **Homework**                          | 35% |  
| **Midtem Exam**                       | 20% |
| **Class participation**               | 10% |
| **Final Exam**                        | 35% |

## Homework

Homework problems will be assigned weekly, and will be due on Wednesday each week.
Students registered for MTH 528 are required to submit homework solutions typeset
in LaTeX. MTH 428 students will receive one bonus point for each homework problem
solution prepared in LaTeX (solutions that show no mathematical effort do not count).

You can collaborate on homework problems, but you must write solutions entirely on your
own. Copying solutions from other students or any other sources is a violation
of the UB academic integrity policy.

Homework assignments will be collected and returned through [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com).

## Class participation

Class participation credit will be based on two components.

**Class attendance.** You can earn up to 5% of the total course credit
for being present and on time during class meetings. You can miss two
class meetings without a justified reason. Each subsequent unexcused absence
will lower your participation credit by 1% (i.e. from 5% to 4% etc.).

**Weekly digest.** As a part of each homework you will be asked to submit
a short (2-3 sentences) writeup on your study from the previous week.
For example, you can write:

* what topics you have found interesting (or boring)
* what topics you have found difficult (or easy)
* how  you feel about the course
* anything else you want to share.

You will be also asked to submit questions that you would like to see discussed
during a class meeting.  

You can receive up to 5% credit for these writeups. You can miss one
such assignment without loosing any credit, but your weekly digest credit will be
lowered by 1% for each subsequent missed assignment.   

I may award extra credit to students who are especially active in the course.
I may also offer some extra credit opportunities for giving short presentations
on some topic etc.
