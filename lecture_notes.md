# Lecture notes

A pdf file with all notes and a LaTex source file are available
[here](https://github.com/bbadzioch/topology_lecture_notes){:target="_blank"}.

I may make some minor changes to these notes during the semester, which can affect
numbering of theorems, exercises etc. The table below and the course schedule page 
for each week will include links to the up-to-date versions of each chapter.
